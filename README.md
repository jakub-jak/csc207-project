John wants to create a personalized digest focused on topics and keywords he previously selected. When generating the digest, the system should automatically search for relevant articles on these topics, summarize each one using an AI assistant, and present them with a brief description, title, link, publication date, and author.

Mark is conducting a study on a particular MNC and wants to stay updated on relevant news. He logs into the app, navigates to the “Update Preferences” section, and selects “Corporate News” and “MNCs” as his preferred topics. His app now displays articles related to his chosen topics. While reading the digest, he notices some articles that are particularly useful for his study. Mark clicks the star icon at the bottom of these articles to save them. Later, he logs into the app and finds all his saved articles conveniently listed under the “My Articles” section for easy reference. [Hriday’s Story]
