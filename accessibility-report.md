### Principles of Universal Design

1. **Equitable Use**
   - Current Feature: The program allows any user to input their preferred keywords and retrieve personalized summaries. This customization ensures it is useful for diverse user needs.
   - Future Idea: Adding text-to-speech capabilities or language translations could make the program more inclusive to people with visual impairments or non-English speakers.

2. **Flexibility in Use**
   - Current Feature: Users can save or unsave articles and email them to themselves or others, providing flexibility in how they interact with the summaries.
   - Future Idea: Implementing voice commands for input and navigation would add another layer of flexibility for users with physical disabilities or those who prefer hands-free operation.

3. **Simple and Intuitive Use**
   - Current Feature: The user-friendly Java Swing UI with clearly labeled buttons (e.g., add keywords, save, and email) ensures simplicity.
   - Future Idea: Including tooltips or a brief onboarding tutorial could help first-time users understand how to use the program without prior experience.

4. **Perceptible Information**
   - Current Feature: Resizable windows help users adjust the program to suit their screen size.
   - Future Idea: Adding visual cues (e.g., highlighting saved articles) and audio notifications (e.g., when the email is sent) would ensure that the information is conveyed through multiple sensory channels.

5. **Tolerance for Error**
   - Current Feature: Users can unsave articles, providing a way to recover from accidental actions.
   - Future Idea: Implementing a confirmation step for actions like sending emails would minimize unintended mistakes.

6. **Low Physical Effort**
   - Current Feature: Minimal interaction is required; users primarily type keywords and click buttons.
   - Future Idea: Adding shortcut keys or automation features (e.g., automatically emailing saved articles daily) would further reduce physical effort.

7. **Size and Space for Approach and Use**
   - Current Feature: The program is accessible to anyone who can run Java and navigate a basic UI.
   - Future Idea: Developing a mobile version or web app would make the program more adaptable to devices with different screen sizes and interaction styles.

### Market Analysis
The program would be marketed toward busy professionals, students, and news enthusiasts who want a quick and efficient way to stay updated on specific topics without sifting through lengthy articles. It appeals to users who value concise information and customizable content delivery, such as those managing a tight schedule or tracking niche interests.

### Demographic Considerations
The program could be less accessible to users with visual or motor impairments due to the lack of accessibility features like text-to-speech or keyboard navigation. Additionally, the reliance on Java limits its usability for users who primarily use mobile devices or non-Java-supported platforms. These gaps could lead to exclusion, emphasizing the need for future enhancements like a web-based version and more robust accessibility options. Including diverse user feedback during updates would help mitigate these limitations.
